		The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
		</p>
		
		<p>Isaiah 34:14<p>

		<p>The wiset of all, in my opinion, is he who can, if only once a month, call himself a fool - a faculty unheard of nowadays.</p>

		<p>Fyodor Dosteovsky, 'Bobok'</p>

		<p>IT is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler th trap he must be caught in.</p>

		<p>Fyodor Dosteovsky, 'Crime and Punishment'</p>

		<p>All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each on holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them.</p>

		<p>Fyodor Dosteovsky, 'The Brothers Karamozov'</p>
