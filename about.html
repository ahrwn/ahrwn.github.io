		<h2>Moi</h2>

		<p>Hello, online you can find me under "ahrwn". I'm an eccentric hobbyist programmer, digital nomad from time to time, and software engineer by trade. I worked 8 years in corperate banking world, crypto start ups, and ivy league colleges. I am mostly interested in psychology, philosophy, unix, and minimalist software.<p>

		<p>I spend most of my time programming, learning the new language of the day (currently into go and c), listening to (folk, techno) music, or reading.</p>

		<p>I'm also interested in travel, ancient history, writing systems, music production, food, and cultures from around the world, among other things.</p>

		<br><br>

		<h2>This site</h2>

		<p>This site is just basic HTML with a single universal stylesheet. I don't use any fancy blogging software or anything like that, I just create and link text files, Currently I'm using Github Pages to host the site but I'll probably rent a server at some point.</p>
